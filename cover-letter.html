            <div class="paragraph">
                In addition to web development, I have built a <strong>cross-platform mobile application using Flutter</strong> that is live on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, alongside a web version. This application features advanced functionality including admin-managed exam systems, video content delivery, real-time group and private messaging, and automated night shift monitoring with alert tracking. My expertise spans the entire development lifecycle‚Äîfrom system architecture and database design to deployment and maintenance.

            <div class="paragraph">
                Prior to my current role, I spent 7+ years at Ineffable Design where I successfully delivered <strong>200+ professional WordPress websites</strong> and managed digital marketing campaigns for multiple clients, achieving measurable ROI improvements.
